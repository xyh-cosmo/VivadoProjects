The total number of clocks on non-clock pins of these cells is greater than 2, therefore, placer is not able to legalize the design to satisfy the suggested number of clocks that can drive non-clock pins in a single tile. Please modify the design such that each cell has at most 2 clocks driving its non-clock pins. Also, if one or more cells should be grouped together and placed in one tile, make sure the total number of such clocks does not exceed the maximum suggested.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net mem_test_m0/px22_reg[10]_LDC_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin mem_test_m0/px22_reg[10]_LDC_i_1/O, cell mem_test_m0/px22_reg[10]_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
